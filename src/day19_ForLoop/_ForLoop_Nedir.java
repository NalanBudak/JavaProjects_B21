    /*     Loop===>repeated statements


        for loop====> gets executed every time when condition is true, and stops when condition becomes false

		for( initialization; Conidtion ; Iterator){

					statements;

		}


		initialization====> starting point

					int i = 0;


		Condition=====> ending point, creatd based on initialization

					i < 5


		Iterator====> co-related to the condition, resposnible for making the condition false, so that the loop will eventually stop


        loops without curly braces===> can only repeat one statement


        BRANCHING STATEMENTS:

          break  =====> used for exiting switch and loop

          continue statement===> skips the current iteration of the loop



while loop===> repeated if statement

  do while ===>gets executed at least once even if the condition is false

Nested Loop==> loop inside another loop

	when do we need nested?
			only if we need to repeat a loop

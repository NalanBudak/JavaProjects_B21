   Class & Object:day40

                 instances:

                         instance variables ==> Object variables, Each object has it's own copy of instance variables.(instance variable accept all variables)

                         instance methods  ===> object methods ,    "does not have static "

		                 this.        =======>  to call instance variables or instance methods

                         this()   ===========>  to call constructor

                         toString ===========>  gets information about object.gets executed automatically when you pass the object in print statement

                         Constructor=========>  used for initializing variable and  creating object.
                                                    if we have instance we can use constructor
                                                    if we have static we can use static block



                 statics:

                         static variable  ====>  belong to the class. 	ONLY one copy

                         static methods   ====>  belong to the class.

                         static initializer block ====> runs first, and only one time

                         static imports   ====> only imports class members.(when we have static we can use static block)

                                                 Static block initialize static variables regardless of the steps
                                                 Static block run "only one time" because there is only one static copy
                                                 Static variables can be called from anywhere as long as they are called from the Class

                        regular import ==>  it is import everything
                        static import  ==>  it is import only static members.
